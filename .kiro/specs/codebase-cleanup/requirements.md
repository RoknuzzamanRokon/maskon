# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves cleaning up the codebase by removing unnecessary files, test files, debug endpoints, and unused functionality to streamline the blog & portfolio website. The goal is to maintain only the essential functionality for a production-ready blog and portfolio site with WhatsApp integration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove all test and debug files, so that the codebase is clean and production-ready.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN the system SHALL identify all test files (test*\*.py, test*_.html, test\__.js)
2. WHEN removing test files THEN the system SHALL preserve any essential configuration files like pytest.ini
3. WHEN cleaning debug files THEN the system SHALL remove temporary files and debug scripts
4. WHEN removing files THEN the system SHALL maintain the core functionality of the blog and portfolio

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove unnecessary API endpoints, so that the API surface is minimal and secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing API endpoints THEN the system SHALL identify debug endpoints (containing /debug/, /test)
2. WHEN removing debug endpoints THEN the system SHALL preserve essential admin endpoints for production use
3. WHEN cleaning endpoints THEN the system SHALL maintain authentication, posts, portfolio, products, and chat functionality
4. WHEN removing endpoints THEN the system SHALL ensure no broken references remain in the frontend

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove unused database migration and setup files, so that only the current schema is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing database files THEN the system SHALL identify redundant migration files
2. WHEN cleaning database files THEN the system SHALL keep the main schema.sql and current setup files
3. WHEN removing migration files THEN the system SHALL preserve the ability to set up the database from scratch
4. WHEN cleaning database files THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity requirements

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove unused frontend components and pages, so that the application is streamlined.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing frontend structure THEN the system SHALL identify unused components and test pages
2. WHEN removing frontend files THEN the system SHALL preserve core pages (blog, portfolio, contact, admin, products)
3. WHEN cleaning components THEN the system SHALL ensure no broken imports remain
4. WHEN removing frontend files THEN the system SHALL maintain the responsive design and functionality

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to consolidate documentation files, so that only essential documentation remains.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing documentation THEN the system SHALL identify redundant markdown files
2. WHEN cleaning documentation THEN the system SHALL preserve the main README.md
3. WHEN removing documentation THEN the system SHALL consolidate implementation summaries into a single file if needed
4. WHEN cleaning docs THEN the system SHALL maintain setup and deployment instructions
