# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the issue where users can select multiple images for products but they are not being properly saved to the database. The system currently has a database structure that supports multiple images per product (product_images table), but the frontend and backend integration is not working correctly to save multiple images.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to upload multiple images for a product, so that customers can see different views and details of the product.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin selects multiple images using the MultiMediaUpload component THEN the system SHALL store all selected image URLs in the product creation data
2. WHEN the product creation form is submitted with multiple images THEN the system SHALL save all images to the product_images table in the database
3. WHEN a product is created with multiple images THEN the first image SHALL be marked as the primary image (is_primary = true)
4. WHEN a product has multiple images THEN all images SHALL be associated with the correct product_id

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to see all uploaded images for a product during creation, so that I can verify the images are correctly selected before saving.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple images are selected THEN the system SHALL display all selected images in a preview
2. WHEN images are selected THEN the system SHALL show the count of selected images
3. WHEN an image is selected as primary THEN the system SHALL visually indicate which image is the primary one

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to view all images of a product, so that I can see different angles and details before making a purchase decision.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a product detail page THEN the system SHALL display all images associated with that product
2. WHEN multiple images exist THEN the system SHALL show the primary image first
3. WHEN viewing product images THEN the system SHALL provide navigation controls to browse through all images
4. WHEN no images exist THEN the system SHALL display a placeholder image

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the API to properly handle multiple image URLs, so that the frontend can successfully save multiple images to the database.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the product creation API receives image_urls array THEN the system SHALL save each URL to the product_images table
2. WHEN saving multiple images THEN the system SHALL set is_primary = true for the first image and false for others
3. WHEN retrieving a product THEN the system SHALL include all associated images in the response
4. WHEN an error occurs during image saving THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages
