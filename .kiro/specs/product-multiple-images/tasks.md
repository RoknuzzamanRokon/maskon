# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Fix backend product creation to properly save multiple images



  - Update the `/api/products` POST endpoint to iterate through `image_urls` array
  - Save each image URL to the `product_images` table with correct `product_id`
  - Set `is_primary = true` for the first image and `false` for others
  - Add proper error handling for database operations
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 4.1, 4.2, 4.4_


- [x] 2. Update backend product retrieval to include image details


  - Modify the `/api/products/{id}` GET endpoint to fetch images from `product_images` table
  - Return both `image_urls` array and detailed `images` array in response
  - Ensure primary image is returned first in the arrays


  - _Requirements: 4.3, 3.2_


- [ ] 3. Fix frontend product creation form to handle multiple images

  - Update `formData` state in create product page to use `image_urls` array instead of single `image_url`
  - Modify `handleMediaSelect` function to collect all selected image URLs into the array


  - Update form submission to send `image_urls` array to backend
  - Remove dependency on single `image_url` field
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 2.2_


- [ ] 4. Update ProductImageGallery component to work with new data structure



  - Modify component to handle both `image_urls` array and `images` array from backend
  - Ensure gallery displays all images with proper navigation
  - Show primary image first and indicate which image is primary
  - Handle cases where no images exist with placeholder
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 2.3_



- [ ] 5. Add comprehensive error handling and user feedback

  - Add error handling in frontend for failed image uploads
  - Display clear error messages when product creation fails
  - Add loading states during image upload and product creation
  - Implement proper error recovery options
  - _Requirements: 4.4_





- [ ] 6. Create unit tests for multiple image functionality

  - Write tests for backend product creation with multiple images



  - Test frontend form handling of multiple images
  - Test ProductImageGallery component with various image configurations
  - Test error scenarios and edge cases
  - _Requirements: All requirements validation_

- [ ] 7. Perform end-to-end testing and validation
  - Test complete flow: upload images → create product → view product → verify images
  - Test with different numbers of images (0, 1, multiple)
  - Verify database consistency after product creation
  - Test image gallery functionality on product detail page
  - _Requirements: All requirements validation_
