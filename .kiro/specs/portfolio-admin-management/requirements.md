# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables administrators to manage the "Featured Projects" section on the portfolio page (http://localhost:3000/portfolio). Administrators need the ability to create, display, and delete project entries through an admin interface, providing full control over the portfolio showcase content.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to access a dedicated admin interface for managing featured projects, so that I can control what projects are displayed on the portfolio page.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator navigates to the admin interface THEN the system SHALL display a projects management dashboard
2. WHEN an administrator is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL redirect to the login page
3. IF the user is authenticated but not an admin THEN the system SHALL display an access denied message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to create new featured projects with relevant details, so that I can showcase work on the portfolio page.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator clicks "Add New Project" THEN the system SHALL display a project creation form
2. WHEN an administrator submits a valid project form THEN the system SHALL save the project to the database
3. WHEN an administrator submits a valid project form THEN the system SHALL display a success confirmation message
4. IF required fields are missing THEN the system SHALL display validation error messages
5. WHEN a project is successfully created THEN the system SHALL immediately display it in the projects list

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to view all existing featured projects in a list format, so that I can see what projects are currently displayed on the portfolio.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator accesses the projects management page THEN the system SHALL display all existing projects in a list
2. WHEN there are no projects THEN the system SHALL display a message indicating no projects exist
3. WHEN projects exist THEN the system SHALL display key project information (title, description, status)
4. WHEN the project list loads THEN the system SHALL order projects by creation date (newest first)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to delete featured projects that are no longer relevant, so that I can keep the portfolio content current and accurate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator clicks a delete button for a project THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation dialog
2. WHEN an administrator confirms deletion THEN the system SHALL remove the project from the database
3. WHEN an administrator confirms deletion THEN the system SHALL remove the project from the displayed list
4. WHEN an administrator cancels deletion THEN the system SHALL keep the project unchanged
5. WHEN a project is successfully deleted THEN the system SHALL display a success confirmation message

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a portfolio visitor, I want to see the featured projects on the portfolio page, so that I can view the showcased work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a visitor navigates to /portfolio THEN the system SHALL display all active featured projects
2. WHEN there are no featured projects THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate message
3. WHEN projects are displayed THEN the system SHALL show project title, description, and any associated media
4. WHEN projects load THEN the system SHALL display them in an organized, visually appealing layout

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want project data to persist reliably, so that featured projects remain available until explicitly deleted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a project is created THEN the system SHALL store all project data in the database
2. WHEN the application restarts THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing project data
3. IF a database error occurs during project operations THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages
