# Email Notification Setup - COMPLETED ✅

## Configuration Status

The email notification system has been successfully configured and tested.

### Current Settings

- **SMTP Server**: smtp.gmail.com
- **SMTP Port**: 465 (SSL)
- **Email Account**: rokon.raz@gmail.com
- **Admin Notifications**: rokon.raz@gmail.com

### Features Enabled

✅ **New Inquiry Notifications**: Automatically sent when customers start new chat sessions  
✅ **Urgent Message Alerts**: Triggered by keywords like "urgent", "help", "broken", "emergency"  
✅ **Assignment Notifications**: Sent when inquiries are assigned to specific admins  
✅ **Priority-based Routing**: High/urgent inquiries trigger immediate email alerts

### Test Results

All email notification types have been successfully tested:

- ✅ New inquiry notification: SUCCESS
- ✅ Urgent inquiry notification: SUCCESS
- ✅ API endpoint integration: SUCCESS
- ✅ Urgent message detection: SUCCESS

### How It Works

1. **New Chat Session**: When a customer creates a new product inquiry, an email is automatically sent to all admin emails
2. **Urgent Messages**: Messages containing urgent keywords trigger immediate email alerts
3. **Assignment**: When an inquiry is assigned to a specific admin, they receive a personalized notification
4. **Real-time**: All notifications are also sent via WebSocket for instant dashboard updates

### Email Templates

The system uses professional HTML email templates that include:

- Customer information (name, email)
- Product details (name, price, category)
- Message content and priority level
- Timestamp and session information
- Direct links to respond (future enhancement)

### Security

- Uses Gmail App Password for secure authentication
- SSL encryption for all email communications
- Sanitized content to prevent email injection
- Rate limiting to prevent spam

### Monitoring

You can monitor email notification status through:

- Admin dashboard notification settings
- API endpoint: `GET /api/admin/notifications/settings`
- Test endpoint: `POST /api/admin/notifications/test-email`
- Server logs for delivery confirmation

### Next Steps

The notification system is ready for production use. Consider:

1. Adding more admin email addresses to `ADMIN_EMAILS` in .env
2. Customizing email templates for your brand
3. Setting up email delivery monitoring
4. Configuring notification preferences per admin

## Testing

To test the system:

```bash
cd backend
python test_notifications.py
```

Or use the admin panel test button in the notification settings.
